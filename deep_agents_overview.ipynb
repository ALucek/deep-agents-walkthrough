    "Language model based applications have moved from simple chat interfaces, to more 'agentic' frameworks. While the definition of what an 'agent' is varies, it generally refers to a system where an LLM is equipped with some tools, and is allowed to operate continuously. It is often with the intent to complete a more complex goal by chaining together multiple actions together, ultimately relying on the reasoning abilities of the language model to determine what steps to take and when to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial approach has worked well, with agentic systems proving more useful, helpful, and capable than their naive chat completions beginnings, ushering in a new wave of interest and investment into arming LLMs with various integrations and tools to be able to perform more complex tasks. Although useful, there still remained a disconnect between the capability of an LLM with digitial tools and a human with the same tools, primarily around 'long-horizon' tasks.\n",

Despite this almost no space is wasted and there is a clear hierarchy of introducing the agent and overall functionality at the beginning, setting tone and behavior, then explicitly describing all available functionality with clear examples delineated by XML tags.\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing examples is used heavily to reinforce behavior and proper tool execution. These are usually not super exact examples (i.e. copying full conversations) but provide higher level overviews with placeholders for actions (eerily similar to `*Does an Action*` style internet writing).\n",
    "3. **Annotated Tools**: Tool use and descriptions are kept mostly to their schemas, i.e. [Claude Code Tools](https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools/blob/main/Claude%20Code/claude-code-tools.json) and show both good and bad examples (back to few shot prompting!)\n",
    "4. **Not All Technical**: Prompting is still (semi) vibes based, important points are reiterated multiple times at multiple different lines, 1st person (i.e. I am XYZ) and 3rd person (You are XYZ) perspectives are used in different tools, some prompts are more uniform (like cursor) than others (manus)\n",

This uniquely provides a memory system that is compressable, restorable, and persistent across the run or runs of an agent.

This lets it pass only the most important context back to the deep agent system in it's final answer without requiring the entire context history be tracked in the main state. This approach is purely an 'agent as a tool' style.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Research Completeness\n",
    "- [ ] Both companies researched with equal depth\n",
    "- [ ] All profile sections have substantive content\n",
    "- [ ] Recent developments within last 12 months included\n",
    "- [ ] Customer feedback and reviews incorporated\n",
    "- [ ] Pricing information as detailed as publicly available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Quality\n",
    "- [ ] Claims supported by evidence and sources\n",
    "- [ ] Balanced perspective without bias\n",
    "- [ ] Strategic insights beyond surface observations\n",
    "- [ ] Actionable recommendations provided\n",
    "- [ ] SWOT analysis based on concrete evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Professional Standards\n",
    "- [ ] Clear, professional writing without jargon\n",
    "- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout\n",
    "- [ ] All sources properly cited\n",
    "- [ ] No speculative statements without clear disclaimers\n",
    "- [ ] Executive summary captures key insights\n",

    "## Tool Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Agent Queries\n",
    "Structure your research queries to be specific and comprehensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Find detailed information about [Company A]'s pricing tiers, packages, and any available pricing documentation\"\n",
    "- \"What are [Company B]'s main product features, integrations, and technical capabilities?\"\n",
    "- \"Search for customer reviews and complaints about [Company A] on G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius\"\n",
    "- \"What recent funding rounds, acquisitions, or partnerships has [Company B] announced in 2024-2025?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poor Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Tell me about [Company A]\" (too vague)\n",
    "- \"Which company is better?\" (not research-focused)\n",
    "- \"Pricing info\" (not specific enough)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critique Agent Usage\n",
    "After drafting each file, use critique-agent with specific focus areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Review**: \"Review company_profiles.md for completeness, accuracy, and balance between both profiles\"\n",
    "2. **Second Review**: \"Evaluate competitive_analysis.md for strategic depth, evidence support, and actionable insights\"\n",
    "3. **Final Review**: \"Check both documents for consistency, professional tone, and proper source citations\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALWAYS:**\n",
    "- Research both companies thoroughly before writing\n",
    "- Support all claims with evidence\n",
    "- Maintain objectivity and professionalism\n",
    "- Include recent developments (within 12 months)\n",
    "- Provide actionable strategic insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**NEVER:**\n",
    "- Make unsupported claims or speculation\n",
    "- Show bias toward either company\n",
    "- Use overly technical jargon\n",
    "- Ignore negative signals or weaknesses\n",
    "- Rush through research phase\n",
    "\n",
    "## Language Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL: The final reports MUST be written in the same language as the user's original request. If the request is in:\n",
    "- English → Write reports in English\n",
    "- Spanish → Write reports in Spanish\n",
    "- French → Write reports in French\n",
    "- [Any other language] → Match that language\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this in your initial plan and maintain consistency throughout all deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Information\n",
    "- Note explicitly what information is not publicly available\n",
    "- Use disclaimers like \"Pricing available upon request\" or \"Customer list not publicly disclosed\"\n",
    "- Never fabricate or estimate missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conflicting Information\n",
    "- Note the discrepancy\n",
    "- Cite multiple sources\n",
    "- Provide the most recent or authoritative version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited Public Information\n",
    "- Focus on available information\n",
    "- Note limitations in the analysis\n",
    "- Suggest alternative research methods if applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: You are producing executive-level competitive intelligence. Every analysis should be thorough, balanced, evidence-based, and strategically insightful.\"\"\""
